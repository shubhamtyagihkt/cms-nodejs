# Project Description

    1. A content management system, often abbreviated as CMS,  is software that helps users create, manage, and modify content on a  website without the need for specialized technical knowledge.
    2. In simpler language, a content management system is a tool that helps  you build a website without needing to write all the code from scratch  (or even know how to code at all).
    3. Instead of building your own system for creating web pages, storing  images, and other functions, the content management system handles all  that basic infrastructure stuff for you so that you can focus on more  forward-facing parts of your website.

# Motivation to Make This Project
1. No Web Programming Experience? No Problem!
A CMS grants you the ability to upload, edit, and delete content from a website without having to know HTML, CSS, or other coding languages.
2. Easy Collaboration
Content management systems allow multiple people to not only have access to your website, but also easily collaborate on different projects. Using individual accounts, multiple people can add, edit, or update content on the site right from their own computers or devices.
3. Easy Access
CMS’ also store all of your online content for you in one place and is available to anyone with access to the website, meaning the need to send multiple different files to different individuals is no longer necessary.
4. Makes Website Maintenance Cost Effective and Affordable
Investing in a content management system can save you both time and money. With a content management system in place, you no longer have to rely on a web developer to make common site changes. You can instantly make these changes yourself exactly when you need them done.
